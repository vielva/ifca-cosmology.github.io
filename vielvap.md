# Patricio Vielva
I am a CSIC Research Scientist at the Instituto de FÃ­sica de Cantabria (IFCA, CSIC - Universidad de Cantabria). You can check my publications <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0051-272X">here</a>, or <a href="https://shorturl.at/xCJMS">here </a>, and some related-statistics <a href="https://shorturl.at/BCOR7">here </a>.

My field of research is observational cosmology, in particular the study of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe, and the relationship between these observables. I have focused mainly on data analysis and the development and application of image processing techniques and statistical methods. I was responsible for novel applications of wavelet- based methods to this field. I have worked in the framework of scientific collaborations, starting with the ESA Planck mission. I am a member of the QUIJOTE experiment and the JAXA-led LiteBIRD mission. I am also a member of the European Low Frequency Survey (ELFS) initiative. As for the LSS, I am a member of the J-PAS galaxy mapping, SKAO and its precursor ASKAP. I am also part of the Science Team of the ARRAKIHS collaboration, the first Spanish-led ESA mission in its Science Program, whose objective is to study the properties and nature of dark matter.
